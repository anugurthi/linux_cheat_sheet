# 7-Day Linux for DevOps Roadmap

Goal: In one week gain practical Linux skills needed for junior DevOps work (automation, services, logs, packaging, networking, containers). Deep admin tasks (RAID, SELinux tuning, kernel builds) are intentionally out of scope.
For optional daily deep dives, see External Learning References section in `README.md` and pick ONE related article per day (capture 3 actionable notes).
# Structured Roadmap (Modules)

Day-Oriented Quick Path (7-Day Compression):
| Day | Modules | Outcome |
|-----|---------|---------|
| 1 | 01-intro, 02-filesystem | Orientation + path literacy |
| 2 | 03-core-commands | Core command fluency |
| 3 | 04-file-ops, 05-permissions | Safe file/text + secure perms |
| 4 | 06-packages | Install/query/verify packages |
| 5 | 07-scripting | Robust script + cron entry |
| 6 | 08-services-logs | Service management + log triage |
| 7 | 09-devops, 10-interview | Integrated workflow + Q&A practice |

Extended Track (2–3 Weeks):
- Week 2: Deepen scripting, text processing, container build loops.
- Week 3: Add basic Ansible and monitoring improvements.

Progress Checklist:
- [ ] Distro chosen and lab ready
- [ ] Filesystem directories explained
- [ ] 20 core commands practiced
- [ ] Pipeline built (grep|cut|sort|uniq)
- [ ] Permissions scenarios mastered
- [ ] Package query & verify done
- [ ] Script with safety flags authored
- [ ] Service created & logs inspected
- [ ] Backup container image built
- [ ] 10 interview questions answered aloud

Next Steps After Core: Learn Git + CI, container orchestration, IaC, monitoring stack.
